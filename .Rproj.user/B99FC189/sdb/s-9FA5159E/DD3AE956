A lot what I'm doing is related to making sense of biological data and interpreting complex models from Machine Learning. This involves visualization of the inherently high dimensional nature of biological data as well as identification of the right model for the problem at hand.\n\nMany of the projects I do for fun or as a learning experience can be found on my [Portfolio](https://portfolio-shiny.netlify.com) and [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/jhooge).",
