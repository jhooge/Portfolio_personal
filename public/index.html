<h2 id="whoami">Whoami</h2>

<p>Hi there, my name is Jens Hooge and I&rsquo;m a Bioinformatician and Machine Learning Engineer, working, living and loving in Berlin.</p>

<h2 id="from-developmental-biology-to-machine-learning">From Developmental Biology to Machine Learning</h2>

<p>Back in 1999, right after finishing my training as a Biological Lab Technician, I stumbled into my first job interview at <a href="http://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de">MPI for Developmental Biology</a>. The position description sounded pretty funky. Something about, &ldquo;Screening of genetic mutations in Zebrafish&rdquo;, &ldquo;Radiation Hybrid Mapping&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Understanding of developmental processes on genomic and phenotypic level&rdquo;. In short, I had no idea what I was getting into. In fact, the dimension of how little idea I had, was made clear to me afterwards by a friend. Excitedly, he told me that I just got interviewed by the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1995, <a href="http://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/nc/research/emeriti/research-group-colour-pattern-formation/profile/details/cnv.html">Christiane Nuesslein-Volhardt</a>. Well, I guess if I had known I would not have gotten the job and probably my professional life would have taken a completely different turn.</p>

<p>There could not have been a more exciting time to get into genetics. The Human Genome Project was at its peak and not even a year later the first drafts of the human sequence were published by <a href="http://www.celera.com">Celera Genomics</a> in the US and the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk">Sanger Institute</a> in the UK. This development led to wild imaginations and ethical discussions, not only in our group, but also world wide. The impact of the newly emerging field of genomics, ranged from individual medicine to designer babies. It was however clear to all of us, that without new mathematical and statistical approaches, working on this huge heap of data would be challenging, to say the least.</p>

<p>Wanted to be part of this development and I decided to attend an evening school to receive my entrance degree for university, to study Bioinformatics. At about the same time <a href="http://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/bs">Bernhard Schölkopf</a>, one of the leading researchers in kernel based Machine Learning, became managing director of our neighboring <a href="http://www.is.mpg.de/en">MPI for Intelligent Systems</a> (formerly: <a href="http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/events/event/view-list%7Cpage_id-2.html?tx_cal_controller%5Byear%5D=2015&amp;tx_cal_controller%5Bmonth%5D=12&amp;tx_cal_controller%5Bday%5D=09">MPI for Biological Cybernetics</a>). His research fascinated me from the start. The idea that computers could learn from &ldquo;experience&rdquo; was a completely new concept to me. There were not many applications of Machine Learning to biological data yet, as Bioinformatics had yet to become a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;. To me however, combining these fields seemed to be the best idea since sliced bread! So I attended every university course, that was even remotely related to these topics.</p>

<p>Ultimately this led me back to the MPI campus at the end of my studies. This time into Bernhard Schölkopf&rsquo;s group for &ldquo;Empirical Inference&rdquo;. Here I had the chance to work on constrained optimization algorithms for about three years, trying to predict protein structures from nuclear magnetic resonance signals. This culminated in the development of <a href="https://github.com/jhooge/RAILIN">RAILIN</a> (Resonance Assignment via Integer LINear Programming) and a diploma thesis. During this time, I lived and breathed research from many exciting field and the scientific cross-talk between, biologists, cyberneticists, cognitive scientists and machine learners is what got me where I am today. Working at the interface between mathematics and precision medicine.</p>

Most of my work I&rsquo;m doing in R and Python, but in the end it comes down to what gets the job done. A lot what I&rsquo;m doing is related to making sense of biological data and interpreting complex models from Machine Learning. This involves visualization of the inherently high dimensional nature of biological data, as well as identification of the right model for the problem at hand.</p>

<p>Many of the projects I do for fun or as a learning experience can be found on my <a href="https://portfolio-shiny.netlify.com">Portfolio</a> and <a href="http://rpubs.com/jhooge">Rpubs</a>.</p>

<p>On my blog &ldquo;<a href="https://perception-machines.netlify.com">Perception Machines</a>&rdquo; I regularly write about topics revolving around Deep- and traditional Machine Learning. Besides rambling about algorithmic techniques, I also discuss interesting new publications I come across during my daily work.</p>

<p>If this is right up your alley, come by or <a href="#contact">drop me a line</a>. I&rsquo;m always happy to discuss these topics with likeminded people.</p>
