On my blog "[Perception Machines](https://perception-machines.netlify.com)" I regularly write about topics revolving around Deep- and traditional Machine Learning. Besides rambling about algorithmic techniques, I also discuss interesting new publications I come across during my daily work. 

If this is right up your alley, come by or [drop me a line](#contact). I'm always happy to discuss these topics with likeminded people.
