Most of my work I'm doing in R and Python, but in the end it comes down to what gets the job done. A lot what I'm doing is related to making sense of biological data and interpreting complex models from Machine Learning. This involves visualization of the inherently high dimensional nature of biological data, as well as identification of the right model for the problem at hand.

Many of the projects I do for fun or as a learning experience can be found on my [Portfolio](https://portfolio-shiny.netlify.com) and [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/jhooge).
